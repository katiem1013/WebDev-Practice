## The Process

This project is something I work on occasionally to learn these new programming languages. I find inspiration for projects everywhere but the most come from seeing a video of others coding projects and thinking: I can do that too. I am new to Web Development, and even newer to Electron so each project requires a lot of research before even beginning. I am really enjoying every step of this learning process and I am excited to keep learning as I go.
